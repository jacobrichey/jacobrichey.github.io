Hi there, my name is Jacob! I grew up in Seattle, Washington, and now find myself across the country in my senior year at the University of Pennsylvania in Philadelphia. I'm studying Economics (in *The College of Arts and Sciences*), with a focus on Econometrics, and triple-minoring in Data Science, Computer Science (*Penn Engineering*) and Statistics (*The Wharton School*). I’m particularly excited about my classes in Market Design and Statistical and Causal Inference in Economics this spring, and to intern for the Tesla Finance Analytics team over the summer.

I came into college with a passion for quantitative analysis across many disciplines, and found my interests in statistics, computer science, and strategic thinking to converge within the broad field of data science. I strongly believe in my ability to continuously improve myself, both mentally and physically, and enjoy learning about topics of interest in my spare time. Currently, my focus ranges from nutrition, fitness, and sports to technology, clean energy, epidemiology, and music. I take motivation from Memorabilia, a collection of Socratic dialogues written by Xenophon (a student of Socrates), and seek to embody the *Renaissance Man* diverse talent of Leonardo da Vinci.

> Besides, it is a disgrace to grow old through sheer carelessness before seeing what manner of man you may become by developing your bodily strength and beauty to their highest limit. But you cannot see that, if you are careless; for it will not come of its own accord. - Xen. Mem. 3.12.8.

I find the statistics and entrepreneurship communities on Twitter particularly useful for short learnings and longer content references. Some of my favorite follows include @seanjtaylor, @david_perell, @daniela_witten, and @suhail. I also welcome you to check out my own [Twitter](https://twitter.com/Richey_Jacob) feed, where I post shorter projects without full write-ups, such as a [mathematical look at the Houston Astros sign stealing](https://twitter.com/Richey_Jacob/status/1262454513283166208), [galaxy-like visualizations of my sleep quality](https://twitter.com/Richey_Jacob/status/1196596855100104704), and a [comparison of crime density in San Francisco and Los Angeles from 2010-Present](https://twitter.com/Richey_Jacob/status/1189950161566330880). I also occasionally share quotes I like. One of my favorites is from Joel Grus’ data science textbook.

I look forward to exploring the Bay Area and tackling whatever new adventures life brings! Feel free to contact me through any of the methods listed at the footer of this webpage.
